<h1>Polidish Public User Assurance</h1>

<p>
Polidish is designed as a neutral venue for political discussion,
writing, and debate. The platform operates on a principle of minimal
intervention and maximum transparency.
</p>

<h2>User Identity & Privacy</h2>

<p>
Polidish does not verify, research, cross-reference, or profile its users
beyond the technical requirements necessary to authenticate access.
Only a limited portion of a user’s email identifier is visible publicly,
and full identities are not assumed or retained by the platform.
</p>

<h2>Data Handling</h2>

<p>
User authentication data is stored securely through a reputable
third-party infrastructure provider. Polidish does not sell, share, or
distribute user identity data to advertisers or third parties.
</p>

<h2>User Content</h2>

<p>
Users control their own content. Posts may be created and deleted by the
author. Posts are not edited or altered by Polidish.
</p>

<h2>Moderation Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Polidish does not enforce subjective community standards. Content is
addressed only when required by law, such as in cases involving direct
harm, child endangerment, or credible threats. Political viewpoints
themselves are not moderated.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
Polidish exists to preserve thoughtful discourse in a time when much of
it has been compressed, curated, or discouraged elsewhere.
